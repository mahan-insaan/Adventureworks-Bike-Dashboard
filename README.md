## Problem Statement: 
The management team needs a way to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers. All I’ve been given is a folder of raw CSV files containing information about transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories.
## Objective:
Connect and transform the raw data
• Build a relational data model
• Create calculated columns and measures with DAX
• Design an interactive dashboard to visualize the data
